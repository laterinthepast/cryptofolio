# Getting Started => Problem

I found a problem using many different crypto wallets that you are unable to share it with someone else without sharing your login details. 


## Solution

Building a crypto wallet with a normal dashboard, charts and option to share it without using your login/password.


Where to get the data from ? 

API from coingecko - popular crypto website. 

Password less login using a 10-15 characters string. 

### What is needed ? 

- UI design -> simple as always
Done in ADOBE XD -> layout, colors, fonts etc

- coingecko API

coingecko website -> axios

- Login/Register page

passwordless login and data storage (where ?)

- Dashboard with wallet, chart (probably from tradingview), list of all available coins (from coingecko) with option to add it to the wallet 

build it for desktop and mobile in future

Timescale - 1 month starting 29th of June
